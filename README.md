# 🧠 Gold Price Prognostication using Multi-Headed Transformer

A deep learning-based time series forecasting project that uses a **custom multi-headed attention Transformer model** to predict future gold prices. This model is designed for financial data modeling using sequence learning, leveraging the power of attention mechanisms in TensorFlow.

---

## 📌 Project Summary

- **Goal:** Predict gold prices using past trends and patterns from historical financial data.
- **Model:** Transformer-based sequence-to-one regression model.
- **Tools Used:** Python, TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.
- **Data:** Historical gold price dataset (custom/preloaded CSV).

## 🧠 Model Architecture

A customized Transformer encoder structure optimized for regression tasks:

- Input Embedding + Positional Encoding
- Multi-Head Self-Attention Mechanism
- Feed-Forward Network with ReLU activation
- Dropout & Layer Normalization
- Final Dense Layer → Single output (predicted gold price)

## 🛠️ How to Run (Colab or Local)

### ✅ Step-by-step:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:tej-o-droid/gold-price-prognostication-multiheaded-transformer.git
   cd gold-price-prognostication-multiheaded-transformer

   
2. (Optional) Install requirements:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Upload your gold price CSV file to the data/ folder.

4.Open the notebook:
   On Google Colab
   Or in JupyterLab / VS Code

5.Run all cells to:
   Preprocess data
   Train the model
   Visualize predictions

6.📈 Sample Results
Training Loss vs Validation Loss plots

Predicted Price vs Actual Price visualizations

Inference for next-day or next-period price

⚠️ Results will vary based on training data volume and parameters.


7.📦 Dependencies
You can manually install key libraries if requirements.txt is not used:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow scikit-learn


✨ Highlights
Built from scratch: No high-level APIs like HuggingFace or Keras premade layers.

Custom multi-head attention logic tailored to time series.

Easily extendable to crypto, stocks, or oil prices.

Plug-and-play notebook with explanations and graphs.
